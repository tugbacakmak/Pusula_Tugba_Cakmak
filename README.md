# Drug Side Effects Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing a dataset related to drug side effects. The main objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocess the dataset for predictive modeling. The dataset contains information such as drug names, side effects, patient demographics, and more. The analysis includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and visualizing relationships within the data.

The final step prepares the data for predictive modeling, ensuring that it is clean and standardized.
